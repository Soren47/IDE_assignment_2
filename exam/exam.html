    <h1>Language Typology  of the World</h1>
    <div class="pair">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Languages can be classified according to their structural and functional features. If this is done for every language in the world,
            it results in a great number of features expressing their differences. For this typological visualisation, a subset of these features
            have been chosen as focus. For these, common properties and structural diversity across languages can be explored.
            <br/>&emsp;Specifically, the visualisation allows for a detailed exploration of nasal pronunciation features and word order. More generally,
            there is an overview of the phonetic inventories of world languages, which qualifies certain features further. Finally, there is a map
            showing which family each language belongs to. Overall, this project gives important significance to particular typological characteristics through an interactive world map.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="pair">
        <h2>Dataset</h2>
        <p>
            The chosen dataset is the World Atlas of Language Structures <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/world-atlas-of-language-structures">(WALS)</a>.
            This dataset contains information on the structure of 2,679 different languages and it provides data regarding the locations,
            families and basic typological features of the languages of the world. Along with the information related to family languages,
            4 categories of features were considered to be analyzed in this project.
            A feature is a structural property of language that describes one aspect of cross-linguistic diversity.

        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="pair">
        <h2>Map navigation</h2>
        <p>
            The default map displays all the languages from the dataset, represented by circles. The map allows the user to click on a circle,
            colouring all languages belonging to the same family <span style="color:green">green </span> and displaying how many this includes
            as well as the family name in the legend. When hovering over a circle, a tooltip is displayed, which also shows the name of the language and its family.
            <br/>&emsp;The selector right of the map allows the user to choose a different visualisation focusing on another feature. One map allows for further
            sub selection. When an option is chosen, specificities of languages regarding a feature will be displayed on the map through different colors and shapes,
            along with an updated legend and a text describing the feature in detail. Subjects like the absence of nasal consonant, the spreading of nasal vowels,
            the order between object and verb/ preposition and noun in a language or the number of consonants or vowels of a language will be analyzed through the interactive map,
            allowing us to explore differences between languages by visualizing them on the map.
            <br/>&emsp;Each visualisation, except “Language Families”, only shows a subset of the 2679 languages, as not all language features are specified for every language.
            Every version of the map can be dragged and zoomed in on, and all language points can be hovered for additional information.

            Nasals are consonants pronounced with a closure in the mouth cavity and the entire flow of air is directed through the nose.
            The oral cavity still acts as a resonance chamber for the sound.

            <br/>&emsp;The sounds associated with the letters <span style="font-style: italic">m, n</span> in English words like <span style="font-style: italic">man</span>
            as well as the sound at the end of words like <span style="font-style: italic">sing<span style="font-style: italic"></span></span> are nasals.
            Nasal consonants are what is called a <span style="font-style: italic">linguistic tendency</span>. As such, it is a feature that
            almost all languages have. Only a total of 13 languages in the data are listed as having no nasals in their consonant inventories.
            The majority of these languages, however, do make use of nasality, but in such a way that simple nasal consonants do not need to
            be considered contrastive segments, e.g. speakers of the Eyak language use both the  [m] and [n] sounds, but [m] is a variant of /w/ before
            a nasalized vowel and [n] is the variant of /l/ in the same position.

            <br/>&emsp;Although there is a number of languages that can be analyzed as having no nasal consonants, it is extremely rare that
            a language fails to make use of nasality entirely, as a part of either its consonant or its vowel system. This is
            simply not used in a contrastive sense where the sound needs to be distinct from another, as for the Eyak speakers. The ability to direct the flow of air through
            the nose is used in one way or another in virtually all human languages <a href="http://wals.info/chapter/18">(WALS, Chapter 18)</a>.

            <br/>&emsp;The map shows the languages without nasal consonants colored in <span style="color:red">red</span>. Almost all languages have nasal consonants.
            Examples of some that do not include in central South America, Niger and Canada.

        <p id="text2" class="text">
            A nasal vowel is a vowel that is produced with a lowering of the velum so that air escapes both through the nose as well
            as the mouth, as is the case for some French vowels. By contrast, oral vowels are vowels without any nasalization. All languages that have
            nasal vowels also have oral vowels, but not all languages that have oral vowels have nasal vowels.
            This is an instance of a <span style="font-style: italic">uni-directional linguistic universal</span>, as it is universal for all languages, but the rule only applies one way.

            <br/>&emsp;The existence of contrastive nasal vowels is well known in some languages, e.g. French <span style="font-style: italic">pain</span> ‘bread’ vs. <span style="font-style: italic">paix</span> ‘peace’.
            About a quarter of the languages in the dataset have a nasal–oral vowel contrast. The number of contrastive nasal vowels in a
            language is often less than that of oral vowels. Oblogatory nasal vowels like these are of far more linguistic importance than whether or not
            speakers of a language tend to nasalize vowels in some instances. Relatively similar languages in the same branch of a
            language family differ on this point quite frequently throughout the world, as is the case for Spanish and Portuguese.


            <br/>&emsp;The map shows the nasal vowels colored in <span style="color:red">red</span> and the oral vowels represented by circles &#3664;.
            There is no language on the map that does not have oral vowels. Nasal vowels are concentrated in
            the following areas: the equatorial regions of South America and Africa, the northern part of the South Asian subcontinent,
            and throughout large parts of North America. They are, with few exceptions, otherwise absent from most of Eurasia, the northern
            and southern extremes of the Americas and Africa, as well as Australia.

            In linguistics, word order typology is the study of the order of the syntactic constituents of a language, and how different
            languages uses different orders. The first feature considered is Word order OV/VO. Here, OV means
            that an object precedes the verb (e.g. Turkish) while VO means that the verbs precedes the object (e.g. Gulf Arabic).
            This is only the case in declarative sentences, e.g. the English 'John loves Mary', compared to an interrogative sentence like 'Does John love Mary?'.

            <br/>&emsp;This feature has been analyzed together with the Order of Adposition and Noun Phrase. There are two types of adpositions:
            prepositions precede the noun phrase they occur with, as in English, while postpositions follow the noun phrase they occur with,
            as in the Lezgian (Russia). Adposition type correlates strongly with the order of object and verb. A tendency is that if a language is an
            OV-language, then it also has postpositionals (and not prepositions). This is a linguistic bi-directional tendency.
            The tendency that an OV-language has postpositionals, is also a tendency the other way around: VO-languages tend to have prepositions.

            <br/>&emsp;The map shows the VO/OV languages in different colors: <span style="color:red">red</span> and
            <span style="font-weight: bold">black</span> and the postpositional/prepositional in
            different shapes (circle &#3664;, square &#9633;). OV predominates over much of Asia, except in the southeast and it also predominates
            in New Guinea. VO order is found in Europe and North Africa. Prepositions predominate in Europe, North Africa and the
            Middle East, central and southern Africa, Southeast Asia, the Pacific Northwest in Canada and the United States.
            Postpositions predominate in most of Asia, except in Southeast Asia, in New Guinea, and North America.

            Languages have different amount of vowels and consonants in their phonetic alphabet. The size of the set of consonants used in the
            language is called the consonant inventory. This is part of the phonology of the language, along with the vowel inventory. The range
            of resulting inventories extends from the low amount of 6 consonants to a high count of 122.

            <br/>&emsp;Consonant inventories close to size 22 ± 3 have been categorized as average. The other inventories are divided into the categories
            'small' (from 6 to 14 consonants), 'moderately small' (15-18), 'moderately large' (26-33), and 'large' (34 or more consonants).
            Languages with average sized consonant inventories are found in most areas of the world, suggesting that the average size is representative
            among spoken human languages. The languages with larger or smaller inventories, on the other hand, display
            quite regional disproportions in their distribution. For example, South America contains a relatively large proportion of
            languages with a 'small' amount of consonants. This is likely due to linguistic familiarity.

            <br/>&emsp;As with consonants, for many languages it is quite straightforward to decide how many vowels there are. Sometimes, however, it can be difficult
            to establish if the sounds are distinct enough to be regarded as separate vowels, or whether a given syllable center should be recognized as consisting
            of one or of two, or even more, parts.
            The average number of vowels in a language is just fractionally below 6. The smallest vowel quality inventory recorded is 2 and the largest 14.

            <br/>&emsp;Absences of three classes of consonant sounds, bilabials, fricatives, and nasals, are available for subselection on the map along
            with nasal vowels. Bilabials are the class of sounds made by bringing the two lips towards each other, especially as in the sounds commonly
            represented by the letters <span style="font-style: italic">p, b, m</span> (for example in the English words <span style="font-style: italic">pub</span>
            and <span style="font-style: italic">mob</span> ).There just 5 languages in the dataset lacking bilabial consonants. All of these languages concerned are from North America.

            <br/>&emsp;Fricatives are the sounds that are created when air from the lungs passes through a sufficiently narrow constriction on its way out of the mouth to set the air
            into a noisy turbulent flow pattern. The sounds at the beginning of the English words <span style="font-style: italic">fan, thin, that, sign, zone</span> are
            fricatives <a href="http://wals.info/chapter/18">(WALS, Chapter 18)</a>. The languages without fricatives are spread in Australia, New Guinea and South America.

            <br/>&emsp;Nasal consonants and nasal vowels have been described on seperate visualisations. There are 13 languages in the dataset that don't have nasals in their consonant inventories.
            These are mainly located in South America and Africa, but now we gain the additional infomation that they are all languages that have relatively few consonants.
            Languages without nasal vowels are much more spread all over the map and with similarly spread vowel inventories, 'large' ones especially concentrated around Asia.

            <br/>&emsp;The map classifies consonant inventory by color and vowel inventory by shape, as shown in the legend.
            Languages with small inventories are frequent in the Americas. The indigenous languages of the Americas quite often have four vowels in a set
            similar to the Spanish vowels, expect for a missing /u/-like vowel. Small vowel inventories are also spread in Australia while the larger ones dominate Africa and Southeast Asia.

            Language families are groups of languages that are related to each other because they come from a common ancestral language.
            The languages in a family are similar in their vocabulary or structure. For example, Spanish, Italian and Breton all come from
            the same family: Indo-European. Language families can be subdivided into smaller units called branches. For instance, the
            Indo-European family has several branches, among them are Germanic, Romance, and Slavic, but these are not the subject of our
            analysis. Most languages belong to a language family, but some languages do not. These languages are called language isolates.
            <br/>&emsp;Clicking on a language in the map will display its entire family as <span style="color:green">green</span> circles
            <span style="color:green">&#3664;</span> as well as show a member count in the legend. Niger-Congo is the largest family with 327
            languages represented on the map, while Tacanan (Brasil) only has 4 languages contained in its the family.
