<h1>The weather changes over the past 100 years in Bucharest</h1>
<svg id="scatterplot" style="width:600px; height:400px"></svg>
<p> The plot above is a scatter plot showing the weather changes (taking into account the meteorological mean temperatures) over the past 100 years in Bucharest. <br/>
    Note that we don't have values for 1976 and 1980 due to external factors (these points have been removed from the data, as the temperatures were NaN-values). <br/>
    Our motivation in choosing a scatter plot is that we work with continuous data (the mean temperatures over a period of time). Scatter plots are mostly used to indicate <br/>
    trends or correlations between dimensions. We want to see the trend of the temperatures during a period of time and there is an increase happening from the '90s on.  <br/>
    The graph might be improved by adding a line between the points to represent better the evolution of the data (the x axis data is ordered so it would not be an inconvenience). <br/>
    Another improvement could be to add the values on top of each point. <br/>
    The data set consists in a csv file containing a column with the mean annual temperature and another one with the year for which we analyze the weather. <br/>
    From the resulting visualization we can conclude that the temperatures in Bucharest differ from one year to another, in the early '30s and '40s <br/>
    evolving from 8 to 11.5 degrees, but remaining between these values until '90s. We can notice an increasing temperature from '90s until present <br/>
    (values between 9 and 12 comparing with lower values in the past). <br/>

<h2>The weather changes between 1880-1969 in Denmark</h2>
<svg id="barplot" width="1300" height="650"></svg>

<p> The plot above is a bar plot showing the weather changes (taking into account the meteorological mean temperatures) over 1880-1969 in Denmark. <br/>
    Our motivation in choosing a bar plot is that, with it we show the differences between the temperature values corresponding to each year and <br/>
    we can easier make comparisons between them. Using the bar plot is helping us also to see the distribution of the data. <br/>
    In terms of the types of the data, here we have considered the period of time (years) as categorical data and the mean annual temperatures as quantitative data.  <br/>
    We can easily highlight the trend of temperatures in Denmark in the mentioned period. The minimum mean annual temperature was registered in 1888 while the maximum <br/>
    1949. The temperatures are actually well-balanced with low differences from one year to another. The temperatures vary from 8 to 10 degrees . <br/>
    The data set consists in a csv file containing a column with the mean annual temperature in Denmark and another one with the year for which we analyze the weather. <br/>
    Since we want to see the evolution over a long period of time, a better approach could have been to group the categorical data and add a line to highlight <br/>
    how the weather have changed during the analyzed period. <br/>

<h3>Question1 (Søren): </h3>
<p>
    To answer the question “How has the weather changed over the past 100 years?”, I would include more data besides temperatures, as weather is a lot of different aspects. <br/>
    Here, the things that people are mostly affected by I would use to represent the change in weather. A more detailed dataset of temperatures could be used to visualize the variance <br/>
    and outliers for each year, as a general increase in temperatures might not be very noticable, but much warmer summers, more heat waves and fewer ice winters might be noticed.<br/>
    Another aspect of weather that could be important would be rainfall. Does it rain more now, than 100 years ago? How different is the wind speeds? Are there more storms and hurricanes now than in the past?<br/>
    A visualization that would work well for this question would be an interactive visualization with multiple views. The user would be able to switch between visualizations of temperature, wind and rainfall.<br/>
    All categories could be represented by barplots to show variance and outliers and show a tendency line. At the same time, it should be able to switch each over to another view of “special events”,<br/>
    like big storms for the wind-screen, ice winters and droughts for the temperature and floods for rainfall.
    The extra datasets and visualizations would give a better view of how the weather has changed over the past 100 years.
</p>
<h3>Question2 (Mihaela): </h3>
<p>
    For the first visualization, the bar plot, I would choose to add a line between the points to show the evolution in weather changes. On mouse over each point, a text box will appear <br/>
    to show the value of the temperature for that specific time (two perpendicular lines could be drawn to show the correspondence between the time - x axis and the value - y axis). <br/>
    For the second visualization, the scatter plot, I would color the bar and add a text box with an information containing the mean temperature corresponding to that year, <br/>
    on mouse over. The maximum and the minimum value will also be specified on mouse over. If the 100 bars will not fit the screen, I could add a coupling navigation or a zooming  <br/>
    feature. Another helpful improvement would be to use a scroll bar (instead of coupling navigation) at the bottom of the chart in order to see more details in the information <br/>
    represented by the bars. <br/>
