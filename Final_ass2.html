<h1>The weather changes over the past 100 years in Bucharest</h1>
<svg id="scatterplot" style="width:600px; height:400px"></svg>
<p> The plot above is a scatter plot showing the weather changes (taking into account the meteorological mean temperatures) over the past 100 years in Bucharest. <br/>
    Note that we don't have values for 1976 and 1980 due to external factors (these points can be seen up in the chart, representing outliers - the values in the data <br/>
    were 999). <br/>
    Our motivation in choosing a scatter plot is that we work with continuous data (the mean temperatures over a period of time). Scatter plots are mostly used to indicate <br/>
    trends or correlations between dimensions. We want to see the trend of the temperatures during a period of time and there is an increase happenning from '90s on.  <br/>
    The graph might be improved by adding a line between the points to represent better the evolution of the data (the x axis data is ordered so it would not be an inconvenient). <br/>
    Another improvement could be to add the values on top of each bar. <br/>
    The data set consists in a csv file containing a column with the mean annual temperature and another one with the year for which we analyze the weather. <br/>
    From the resulting visualization we can conclude that the temperatures in Bucharest differs from one year to another, in the early '30s and '40s <br/>
    evolving from 8 to 11,5 degrees, but remaining between these values until '90s. We can notice an increasing temperature from '90s until present <br/>
    (values between 9 and 12 comparing with lower values in the past). <br/>

<h2>The weather changes between 1880-1969 in Denmark</h2>
<svg id="barplot" width="1300" height="650"></svg>

<p> The plot above is a bar plot showing the weather changes (taking into account the meteorological mean temperatures) over 1880-1969 in Denmark. <br/>
    Our motivation in choosing a bar plot is that, with it we show the differences between the temperature values corresponding to each year and <br/>
    we can easier make comparisons between them. Using the bar plot is helping us also to see the distribution of the data. <br/>
    In terms of the types of the data, here we have considered the period of time (years) as categorical data and the mean annual temperatures as quantitative data.  <br/>
    We can easily highlight the trend of temperatures in Denmark in the mentioned period. The minimum mean annual temperature was registered in 1888 while the maximum <br/>
    1949. The temperatures are actually well-balanced with low differences from one year to another. The temperatures vary from 8 to 10 degrees . <br/>
    The data set consists in a csv file containing a column with the mean annual temperature in Denmark and another one with the year for which we analyze the weather. <br/>
    Since we want to see the evolution over a long period of time, a better approach could have been to group the categorical data and add a line to highlight <br/>
    how the weather have changed during the analyzed period. <br/>
</p>

<p> Question2 (Mihaela):
    For the first visualization, the bar plot, I would choose to add a line between the points to show the evolution in weather changes. On mouse over each point, a text box will appear <br/>
    to show the value of the temperature for that specific time (two perpendicular lines could be drawn to show the correspondence between the time - x axis and the value - y axis). <br/>
    For the second visualization, the scatter plot, I would color the bar I will mouse over and I will add a text box with an information containing the mean temperature <br/>
    corresponding to that year. The maximum and the minimum value will also be specified on mouse over. <br/>
