<h1>The Trump pedigree tree</h1>
<div id="graph"></div>
<p class = "normalText">
    Press a name on the pedigree tree and an image of the person will be shown.<br/>
    For grandchildren of Donald Trump, a family portrait will be shown. <br/>
    You can move the family tree around by clicking and holding on the tree or the white space around it.
</p>
<img id ="photo" src="ass3_images/Portrait_placeholder.jpg" height="300" width="300">
<p id ="photoText">Here an attribution to the author of a a portrait will be shown.</p>

<h2>Motivation for choices in visualization</h2>
<p class="normalText">
    As a pedigree tree is all about children, the couplings with the most descendants are situated front left in the tree.
    Naturally, Donald Trump is at the very top. He is central to the matter at hand after all.
    The Trump family is a very traditional and conservative family, therefore each person's gender is conservatively defined:
    Pink for women and blue for men. <br/>
    &emsp;The family tree is quite wide, Donald Trump having many marriages, so the whole tree is not visible and readable all at once.
    Therefore we have made it possible to drag and zoom in the tree.
    When you click on a node of a person in the tree, a picture of that person is shown below.
    Alternatively, the picture could have replaced the node itself, but that would have required too much zooming to make sense.
    Below the picture, a reference to its origin is displayed.
</p>
<h2>Possible improvements to the visualization</h2>
<p class="normalText">
    The visualization could be improved by more interactivity and more information about the people and their relations.
    Furthermore it could have a less awkward initial position/zoom. The connections between nodes could also display what
    year the connection was established, i.e. birth year of descendants and year of marriage/divorce for partners.<br/>
    &emsp;An animation could show this changing relations between people even better. This would provide a great chronological
    overview of the family tree progression. This could show a counter of what the current year was, and then new links of relations
    between people could pop up, along with new people nodes popping up in the diagram as babies were born.
    More information about relatives could be shown when they are selected. This could be a summary of a Wikipedia-article,
    their latest tweets or maybe a link to a photo series. <br/>
    &emsp;The story itself could easily be guided with what information is shown. A negative story could highlight some of
    the more unfortunate tweets by Donald Trump, criticize his policies or focus on sexual harassment allegations made against him.
    A more positive story supporting Donald Trump could show his patriotic tweets, show his big assemblies of people or
    highlight good policies matching the story.
