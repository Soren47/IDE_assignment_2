<h1>The weather changes over the past 100 years in Bucharest</h1>
<svg id="scatterplot" style="width:600px; height:400px"></svg>
<p> The plot above is a scatter plot showing the weather changes (taking into account the meteorological mean temperatures) over the past 100 years in Bucharest. <br/>
    Note that the y-axis starts at 7. Furthermore, we the values for 1976 and 1980 were missing due to external factors, so these points have been removed.<br/>
    Our motivation in choosing a scatter plot is that we work with continuous data (the mean temperatures over a period of time). Scatter plots are mostly used to indicate <br/>
    trends or correlations between dimensions. We want to see the trend of the temperatures during a period of time and there is an increase happening from the '90s on.  <br/>
    The graph might be improved by adding a line between the points to represent better the evolution of the data (the x axis data is ordered so it would not be an inconvenience). <br/>
    Another improvement could be to add the values on top of each point. <br/>
    The data set consists of a csv file containing a column with the mean annual temperature and another one with the year for which we analyze the weather. <br/>
    From the resulting visualization we can conclude that the temperatures in Bucharest differ from one year to another, in the early '30s and '40s <br/>
    evolving from 8 to 11.5 degrees, but remaining between these values until '90s. We can notice an increasing temperature from '90s until present <br/>
    (values between 9 and 12 comparing with lower values in the past). <br/>

<h2>The weather changes between 1880-1969 in Tarm, Denmark</h2>
<svg id="barplot" width="1300" height="650"></svg>

<p> The plot above is a bar plot showing the weather changes (taking into account the meteorological mean temperatures) from 1880-1969 in Denmark. The years 1938, 1939,<br/>
    1954, 1960, 1962 and 1963 have been left out due to missing data. Our motivation in choosing a bar plot is to show the differences between the temperature values<br/>
    corresponding to each year clearly so we can easily make comparisons between them. Using the bar plot also helps us see the distribution of the data. Furthermore,<br/>
    we got to practise making a bar plot. This particular one is heavily influenced by the example chart made by Mike Bostock.<br/>
    &emsp;In terms of the types of the data, here we have considered the period of time (years) as ordered categorical data and the mean annual temperatures as quantitative data.<br/>
    We can easily highlight the trend of temperatures in Denmark in the mentioned period. The minimum mean annual temperature was registered in 1888 while the maximum <br/>
    1949. The temperatures are actually well-balanced with low differences from one year to another. The temperatures vary from 8 to 10 degrees.<br/>
    The data set consists of a csv file containing a column with the mean annual temperature in Denmark and another one with the year for which we analyze the weather.<br/>
    Since we want to see the evolution over a long period of time, a better approach could have been to group the categorical data and add a line to highlight <br/>
    how the weather have changed during the analyzed period.<br/>
    &emsp;All in all we prefer the scatter plot for this type of visualisation, but making the bar plot has been a useful lesson. The 0-5 chunk of the bars is basically<br/>
    waste of visualisation space, and the smaller differences between the bar tops could be made clearer if scattered. The relatively large bar count is of some concern<br/>
    as well. Even though they are logically ordered, disregarding the missing years, some bars do reach a point where they are difficult to compare.

<h3>Question1 (Søren): </h3>
<p>
    To answer the question “How has the weather changed over the past 100 years?”, I would include more data besides temperatures, as weather is a lot of different aspects. <br/>
    Here, the things that people are mostly affected by I would use to represent the change in weather. A more detailed dataset of temperatures could be used to visualize the variance <br/>
    and outliers for each year, as a general increase in temperatures might not be very noticeable, but much warmer summers, more heat waves and fewer ice winters might be noticed.<br/>
    Another aspect of weather that could be important would be rainfall. Does it rain more now, than 100 years ago? How different is the wind speeds? Are there more storms and hurricanes now than in the past?<br/>
    A visualization that would work well for this question would be an interactive visualization with multiple views. The user would be able to switch between visualizations of temperature, wind and rainfall.<br/>
    All categories could be represented by barplots to show variance and outliers and show a tendency line. At the same time, it should be able to switch each over to another view of “special events”,<br/>
    like big storms for the wind-screen, ice winters and droughts for the temperature and floods for rainfall.
    The extra datasets and visualizations would give a better view of how the weather has changed over the past 100 years.
</p>
<h3>Question2 (Mihaela): </h3>
<p>
    For the first visualization, the bar plot, I would choose to add a line between the points to show the evolution in weather changes. On mouse over each point, a text box will appear <br/>
    to show the value of the temperature for that specific time (two perpendicular lines could be drawn to show the correspondence between the time - x axis and the value - y axis). <br/>
    For the second visualization, the scatter plot, I would color the bar and add a text box with an information containing the mean temperature corresponding to that year, <br/>
    on mouse over. The maximum and the minimum value will also be specified on mouse over. If the 100 bars will not fit the screen, I could add a coupling navigation or a zooming  <br/>
    feature. Another helpful improvement would be to use a scroll bar (instead of coupling navigation) at the bottom of the chart in order to see more details in the information <br/>
    represented by the bars. <br/>
</p>
<h3>Question3 (Veronica): </h3> 
<p>
    Too large datasets loaded into the browser can easily lag it out, especially if these are animated. However, before this point is reached, many visualisation types will hit their<br/>
    wall with regard to sensible scaling. A normal scatter plot can perhaps take hundreds of points, provided they are spread enough to still be visible. Bar plots are stricter yet,<br/>
    reasonably allowing only tens to a hundred categories. If the logical bar ordering is strong, it will allow for the upper end of this scale.<br/>
    &emsp;One impossibly large data set would be a true social network. For each new person, or node, many new child nodes would pop up, and eventually the entire human population<br/>
    would probably be covered. In visualisations of these, one core person is usually picked, and only this person's network can be linked. More examples of large data visualised simply<br/>
    are shown at every stock market. The ever-changing values are indicated by simple floats, either positive or negative, yet masses of data lie underneath.<br/> 
    &emsp;For this assignment, the temperature needs to be shown as a progress over the years, so all data points are needed. Indeed, the Danish weather data should have gone further<br/>
    up than 1969, but a better data set was only found too late in the process.
