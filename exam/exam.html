        Nearly all nasal consonants are nasal occlusives, in which air escapes through the nose but not through the mouth,
        as it is blocked (occluded) by the lips or tongue. The oral cavity still acts as a resonance chamber for the sound. Rarely, non-occlusive consonants may be nasalized.

        <br/>&emsp;Most nasals are voiced, and in fact, the nasal sounds [n] and [m] are among the most common sounds cross-linguistically. Voiceless nasals occur in a few languages such as
        Burmese, Welsh, Icelandic and Guaraní. (Compare oral stops, which block off the air completely, and fricatives, which obstruct the air with a narrow channel. Both stops and
        fricatives are more commonly voiceless than voiced, and are known as obstruents.)

        <br/>&emsp;In terms of acoustics, nasals are sonorants, which means that they do not significantly restrict the escape of air (as it can freely escape out the nose). However, nasals
        are also obstruents in their articulation because the flow of air through the mouth is blocked. This duality, a sonorant airflow through the nose along with an obstruction
        in the mouth, means that nasal occlusives behave both like sonorants and like obstruents. For example, nasals tend to pattern with other sonorants such as [r] and [l], but
        in many languages, they may develop from or into stops.
    </p>
    <p id="text2" class="text">
        A nasal vowel is a vowel that is produced with a lowering of the velum so that air escapes both
        through the nose as well as the mouth, such as the French vowel About this sound /ɑ̃/ (help·info). By contrast, oral vowels are vowels without the nasalization.
        As explained below, nasal vowels that are distinctive or obligatory are of far more linguistic importance than whether or not speakers of a language tend to nasalize
        vowels in some instances. Relatively similar languages in the same branch of a language family differ on this point quite frequently throughout the world, such as in
        Spanish and Portuguese.[citation needed]

        <br/>&emsp;In most languages, vowels that are adjacent to nasal consonants are produced partially or fully with a lowered velum in a natural process of assimilation and are therefore
        technically nasal, but few speakers would notice. That is the case in English: vowels preceding nasal consonants are nasalized, but there is no phonemic distinction between
        nasal and oral vowels (and all vowels are considered phonemically oral).

        <br/>&emsp;However, the words "huh?" and "uh-huh" are pronounced with a nasal vowel, as is the negative "unh-unh".

        In linguistics, word order typology is the study of the order of the syntactic constituents of a language,
        and how different languages can employ different orders. Correlations between orders found in different syntactic sub-domains are also of interest. The primary word orders
        that are of interest are the constituent order of a clause – the relative order of subject, object, and verb; the order of modifiers (adjectives, numerals, demonstratives,
        possessives, and adjuncts) in a noun phrase; and the order of adverbials.

        <br/>&emsp;Some languages use relatively restrictive word order, often relying on the order of constituents to convey important grammatical information. Others—often those that convey
        grammatical information through inflection—allow more flexibility, which can be used to encode pragmatic information such as topicalisation or focus. Most languages, however,
        have a preferred word order,[1] and other word orders, if used, are considered "marked".

        Depending on your dialect, you might also have vowels in some of BOUGHT, BAUD, BUTTE, BOUY (like BOOEY but as a single syllable), BART, BORE, BEAR, or BALM that are different
        from any of the first fourteen vowels. And depending on how well you pronounce your borrowed French or German words, you may even have two more vowels, as in BU (French
        "drank" or German  "over") and BOEUF (French beef or German schön "beautiful"). No wonder dictionary pronunciation guides are complicated!
