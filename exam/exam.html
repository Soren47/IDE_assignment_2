<h1>Language Typology  of the World</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
    Languages can be classified according to their structural and functional features. This results in many differences between languages.
    The language typology of the world map describes the common properties and the structural diversity of the world's languages,
    given some specific feature chosen for this purpose. We can distinguish, for example, between languages with a relatively rich phonemic inventory
    languages with a relatively poor phonemic inventory, languages with a high percentage of consonants to vowels from languages with a low percentage of
    consonants to vowels, languages with a fixed word order from languages with a free word order, prefixing languages from suffixing languages,
    and much more other cases.

    This project gives important significance to particular typological characteristics through a geographical interactive map.
</p>

<h2>Dataset</h2>
<p>
    The chosen dataset is The World Atlas of Language Structures <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/world-atlas-of-language-structures">(WALS)</a>.
    This dataset contains information on the structure of 2,679 of languages and it provides information on the location,
    language families, dialects and basic typological features of the world's languages considered. Along with the information related to family languages, 4
    features were considered to be analyzed in this project. A feature is a structural property of language that describes one aspect of cross-linguistic diversity.
</p>

<h2>Map navigation</h2>
<p>
    The default map displays all the languages from the dataset, represented by circles. The map allows the user to click on a circle so that all the languages that belong
    to the same family will be <span style="color:green">colored in green </span>and the number of the languages belonging to the same family will be displayed in the legend.
    When hovering over a circle, a tooltip is displayed showing the name of the language accessed and its family.
    A filter allows the user to choose on option from a list in order to visualize some important information about a specific language feature.
    When deciding for an option, specificities of languages regarding a feature will be displayed on the map through different colors and shapes, along with a legend
    and a text that will describe in details the feature. Subjects like the absence of nasal consonant, the spreading of nasal vowals, the order between object and verb/
    preposition and noun in a language or the number of consonants or vowels of a language will be analyzed through the interactive map, allowing us to conclude about
    the differences between languages by visualizing them on the map.
    Everytime a feature is selected, the user has the option to zoom the map and move it horizontally or vertically.

            Nasals are consonants in which there is a closure in the mouth cavity and the entire flow of air is directed through the nose.
            The oral cavity still acts as a resonance chamber for the sound.

            <br/>&emsp; The sounds associated with the letters m, n in English words like man as well as the sound at the end of words like sing are nasals.
            A total of 13 languages in the sample are listed as having no nasals in their consonant inventories. The majority of these languages, however, do make use of nasality,
            but it patterns in such a way that simple nasal consonants do not need to be considered contrastive segments.he case of Eyak has been mentioned above. Although both [m] and [n] sounds
            are heard in this language, [m] is a variant of /w/ before a nasalized vowel and [n] is the variant of /l/ in the same position. although there are a number of languages which can be
            analyzed as having no nasal consonants, extremely few of the world’s languages fail to make use of nasality either as a part of their consonant system or as part of
            their vowel system. The ability to direct the flow of air through the nose is used in one way or another in virtually all human languages. [http://wals.info/chapter/18]

            <br/>&emsp; The map shows the languages without nasal consonants colored in red. Almost all languages have nasal consonants. There are few languages that do not contain
            nasal consonats: in central South America, Niger and Canada.

        </p>
        <p id="text2" class="text">
            A nasal vowel is a vowel that is produced with a lowering of the velum so that air escapes both
            through the nose as well as the mouth, such as the French vowels. By contrast, oral vowels are vowels without the nasalization.
            As explained below, nasal vowels that are obligatory are of far more linguistic importance than whether or not speakers of a language tend to nasalize
            vowels in some instances. Relatively similar languages in the same branch of a language family differ on this point quite frequently throughout the world,
            such as in Spanish and Portuguese.[Wikipedia]

            <br/>&emsp;The existence of contrastive nasal vowels is well known in some languages, e.g. French pain ‘bread’ vs. paix ‘peace’.
            About a quarter of the languages in the data have a nasal–oral vowel contrast. The number of contrastive nasal vowels in a language is often less than that
            of oral vowels.

            <br/>&emsp;The map shows the nasal vowels colored in red and the oral vowels represented by circles. There is no language on the map that does not have oral vowels.
            Nasal vowels are concentrated in the following areas: the equatorial regions of South America and Africa, the northern part of the South Asian
            subcontinent, and throughout large parts of North America. They are, with few exceptions, otherwise absent from most of Eurasia, the northern and southern
            extremes of the Americas and Africa, as well as Australia.

            In linguistics, word order typology is the study of the order of the syntactic constituents of a language,
            and how different languages can use different orders. The feature consisting in Word order OV/VO is explained as following: OV means that an object precedes the verb
            (e.g. Turkish) while VO means that the verbs precedes the object (e.g. Gulf Arabic).

            <br/>&emsp;This feature has been analyzed together with the Order of Adposition and Noun Phrase.
            There are two types of adpositions: prepositions precede the noun phrase they occur with, as in English, while postpositions follow the noun phrase they occur with,
            as in the Lezgian (Russia).
            Adposition type correlates strongly with the order of object and verb. A tendency is that a laguage is an OV-language, then also have postpositionals
            (and not prepositions).

            <br/>&emsp; The map shows the VO/OV languages in different colors: red and black and the postpositional/prepositional in different shapes (circle, square).
            OV predominates over much of Asia, except in the southeast and it also predominates in New Guinea. VO order is found in Europe and North Africa.
            Prepositions predominate in Europe, North Africa and the Middle East, central and southern Africa, Southeast Asia, the Pacific Northwest in Canada and the United
            States. Postpositions predominate in most of Asia, except in Southeast Asia, in New Guinea, and North America.

        </p>
        <p id="text4" class="text">
            Languages have different amount of vowels and consonants in their alphabet. The size of the set of consonants used in the language, usually is called the consonant inventory.
            This is part of the phonology of the language, along with the vowel inventory. The range of resulting inventories extends from a low of 6 consonants to a high of 122.
            Consonant inventories close to size 22 ± 3 have been categorized as average. The other inventories are divided into the categories like small (from 6 to 14 consonants),
            moderately small (15-18), moderately large (26-33), and large (34 or more consonants). Languages with average size consonant inventories are found in most areas of the world,
            suggesting that the average size is representative among spoken human languages. The languages with larger or smaller inventories on the other hand display
            quite regional disproportions in their distribution (small number of consonants are used in languages from South America, for example).

            <br/>&emsp;As with consonants, for many languages it is quite straightforward to decide how many vowels there are, but in other cases there are some difficult
            questions to resolve (whether a given syllable center should be recognized as consisting of one or of two (or even more) parts).
            The average number of vowels in a language is just fractionally below 6. The smallest vowel quality inventory recorded is 2 and the largest 14.

            <br/>&emsp;The map displays each category of consonant inventory size in a language with a color and each category of vowel inventory size with a shape.
            Languages with small inventories are frequent in the Americas. The indigenous languages of the Americas quite often have four vowels in a set
            similar to that of Spanish except for missing an /u/-like vowel. Small vowel inventories are also spread in Australia while the larger ones dominate Africa and Southest Asia.

        </p>
        <p id="text5" class="text">
            Language families are groups of languages that are related to each other because they come from a common ancestral language. The languages in a family
            are similar in their vocabulary or structure. For example, Spanish, Italian, Breton all come from the same family: Indo-European.
            Language families can be subdivided into smaller units called branches. For instance, the Indo-European family has several branches, among them, Germanic, Romance, and Slavic,
            but these are not the subject of our analysis.
            Most languages belong to a language family, but some languages do not. These languages are called language isolates.

            <br/>&emsp;Clicking on a language from the map will display in green circles all the members and their number belonging to the family to which the chosen language belongs.
            Niger-Congo is the family that contains 327 languages represented on the map, while Tacanan (Brasil) has only 4 languages contained in the family.
