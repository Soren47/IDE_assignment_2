<p> The plot above is a bar plot showing the weather changes (taking into account the meteorological mean temperatures) over 1880-1969 in Denmark. <br/>
    Our motivation in choosing a bar plot is that, with it we show the differences between the temperature values corresponding to each year and <br/>
    we can easier make comparisons between them. Using the bar plot, we can also see the distribution of the data. <br/>
    Here we have considered the period of time (years) as categorical data and the mean annual temperatures as quantitative data.  <br/>
    We can easily highlight the trend of temperatures in Denmark in the mentioned period. The minimum mean annual temperature was registered in 1888 while the maximum <br/>
    1949. The temperatures are actually well-balanced with low differences from one year to another. The temperatures vary from 8 to 10 degrees . <br/>
    The data set consists in a csv file containing a column with the mean annual temperature in Denmark and another one with the year for which we analyze the weather. <br/>
    Since we want to see the evolution over a long period of time, a better approach could have been to group the categorical data and add a line to highlight <br/>
    how the weather have changed during the analyzed period. <br/>
