    <h1 id="id1">How has the weather changed over the past 100 years in Bucharest</h1>
    <svg style="width:600px; height:400px" id="scatterplot"></svg>
    <p> The plot above is a scatter plot showing the weather changes (taking into account the meteorological mean temperatures) over the past 100 years in Bucharest. <br/>
    Note that we don't have values for 1976 and 1980 due to external factors (these points can be seen up in the chart, representing outliers - the values in the data <br/>
    were 999). <br/>
    Our motivation in choosing a scatter plot is that we work with continuous data (the mean temperatures over a period of time). Scatter plots are mostly used to indicate <br/>
    trends or correlations between dimensions. We want to see the trend of the temperatures during a period of time and there is an increase happenning from '90s on.  <br/>
        The graph might be improved by adding a line between the points to represent better the evolution of the data (the x axis data is order so it would not be an inconvenient). <br/>
    The data set consists in a csv file containing a column with the mean annual temperature and another one with the year for which we analyze the weather. <br/>
    From the resulting visualization we can conclude that the temperatures in Bucharest differs from one year to another, in the early '30s and '40s <br/>
    evolving from 8 to 11,5 degrees, but remaining between these values until '90s. We can notice an increasing temperature from '90s until present <br/>
    (values between 9 and 12 comparing with lower values in the past). <br/>
